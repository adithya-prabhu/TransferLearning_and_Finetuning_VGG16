# TransferLearning_and_Finetuning_VGG16

In this project I have classfiied wastage garbage collection into several classes by methods like Transfer Learning and Fine tuning VGG - 16.

The difference between Transfer Learning and Fine-Tuning is that

1) In Transfer Learning, we only optimize the weights of the new classification layers we have added, while we keep the weights of the original VGG16 model.

2) In Fine-Tuning we optimize both the weights of the new classification layers we have added, as well as some or all of the layers from the VGG16 model.

ConvNets, a type of artificial neural network, are sometimes referred to as convolutional neural networks. An input layer, an output layer, and several hidden layers make up a convolutional neural network. Convolutional neural networks, or CNNs, like the VGG16 model are thought to be among the best computer vision models available today. VGG16 is object detection and classification algorithm which is able to classify 1000 images of 1000 different categories with 92.7% accuracy. It is one of the popular algorithms for image classification and is easy to use with transfer learning.
